## Who am I ?
- A self-taught web dev graduated from the Faculty of Econs. Based in Tokyo (2020) and got my first *software engineering position* (trial) in August 2020.

## Currently Learning 
### VueJS
- Small size but powerful JavaScript framework
- Will continue use it as my ***main*** developing framework
